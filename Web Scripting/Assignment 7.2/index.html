		<p>Hello, my name is Cameron Block, and I am 23 years old. I am going for the programming degree here at Bellevue University. I am very driven to achieve, and maintain a relatively high GPA of currently a 3.8. I am very interested in programming; some of the languages I have taken are Java, Visual Basic.NET I, C++, C, C#, and ASP.NET. I have also taken Calculus 1, and 2, and got A&#39;s in both of them. I am also very interested in computer security and networking. A few other things I have coded in, but have not necessarily taken classes in are Android, and Python. Syntactically, my two favorite languages are C# and Java. In my free time I play around with computer security related things like the Wi-Fi Pineapple. </p>
		<p>My favorite movie is Jurassic Park: </p>
