    <h2>
        About
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a website constructed solely for the demonstration of my C# and ASP.NET 
        coding abilities. This site does have a registration option, and will ask you 
        for your email address, name, and other information. This site is my playground, 
        and I reserve the right to run random queries and code that I find or invent. I 
        will of course never knowingly distribute your information. I don&#39;t expect this 
        site to be available for very long after my class ends. All the products 
        available are purely fictitious. This website will probably be run on my home 
        PC, so do not expect terribly good service. We have learned about various web 
        server vulnerabilities and therefore I will be validating input.
